Cron Job(Gowtham):  
a scheduled time for a cloud function to trigger
Notification

Calendar Cloud Function(Davis):  
Make a cloud function that first fetches data from user's calendar, scrapes through data and returns back a "beautified" json format. (We will later make a new function that actually adds this to our calendar. One of my functions does that already so we will worry about that later)  

Notification Class(Tex and Allen):  
Make a notification class that looks at all of our scheduled events and actually gives notifications on what materials we need

# How object Oriented Programming works

**Simple Class example in Typescript:**  
Bankaccount.ts looks like this:  
```

export class BankAccount{
    private balance:number;
    
    public constructor(initial_amount:number){
        this.balance = initial_amount;
    }
    
    public deposit(new_money:number):void{
        this.balance += new_money;
    }
    
    public withdraw(money_to_take_out:number):void{
        this.balance -= money_to_take_out;
    }

    public getBalance():number{
        return this.balance;
    }
    
}
```

Index.ts looks like this:  
```
import {BankAccount} from './BankAccount.ts'

var Gowtham_Bank_Account = new BankAccount(500);

var gowtham_initial_balance = Gowtham_Bank_Account.getBalance();
console.log(initial_balance);

Gowtham_Bank_Account.deposit(6000000);

var gowtham_final_balance = Gowtham_Bank_Account.getBalance();
console.log(gowtham_final_balance)


var Allen_Bank_Account = new BankAccount(1000);
var allen_balance = Allen_Bank_Account.getBalance();
console.log(allen_balance);
```  
So let's break this down. Take a look at BankAccount.ts. I started out with `export`. This is basically just a typescript thing where if we want something from one file to be used in another file we use this. In this case I want the `BankAccount` class to be used in the **Index.ts**. Now here comes the main part. 

After I wrote `export` I typed in something called **`class`**. Now a class is basically something where we dump many functions and variables that relate to a topic. So in my example I made a `export class BankAccount` class. My `BankAccount` class has everything I want in order to make a BankAccount. So what does a Bank Account do? It holds our money for us right? It keeps track of our money, which is called our **balance**. What else can we do with a Bank Account? We can **deposit** money or **withdraw** money. Instead of writing some stray, random, and hard to keep track of variables and functions, why not we group them all together. Why Not we have one big group called a **class** that allows us to make a **`BankAccount` Object** that contains it's own **balance variable, deposit, and withdraw functions**?  

So anytime someone calls our **BankAccount class**, they are basically making a new Object that has it's own **balance variable, deposit, and withdraw functions**.  

So let's look closely at our class now. Where I put `private balance:number;` I am basically declaring a variable. So there is a big difference between *declaring* and *initializing*. 

Declaring is basically when you let typescript know that you want to make a variable but you don't want to give it any value  

Initializing is when you want a variable to have a value.  

Here are some examples of initializing and declaring:-  

Declaring:  
`var name;`  
`var money;`

Initializing:  
`var name = "Gowtham";`  
`var money = 10000000000;`  

When you declare a variable typescript knows you want to have variable but you aren't really sure what it's value will be just yet. Initializing is when you actually assign it a value. 

Next thing we need to understand is the difference between `public` and `private`. The public keyword is used when we want something to be used inside outside our class. The private keyword is used when we don't want something to be used outside our class. So in this case we don't want people to be directly messing with our `balance` variable so we keep that *private*. Anything with a *private* keyword in front of it will only allow something  

Now back to our code. Look at `private balance:number;`. Now we covered `private` and `balance` but what does the `:number` mean? It basically is telling typescript that is the ***type*** of the variable to typescript. In programming, we have something called ***types*** which lets the computer know what is the nature of whatever we are creating. So some examples of types are ***integer, boolean, double, float, String etc.*** These are the type of things we can create in our program. In the case of our variable `private balance:number;`, we basically telling typescript *"hey this variable is gonna be a number"*.  

The below code will work: 

`private balance:number = 1000;`  

This will ***NOT*** work:   

`private balance:number = "1000";`  


The reason the second code snippet won't work is because we are trying to store a string into a variable that we said will hold a number. If you want to store a string then we have to change `number` to `string` like so:  

`private balance:string = "1000";`  
 
The code above will work.  

So let's combine this all together. We are **declaring** a variable that is **private** that is going to store a **number**. 

This balance variable belongs to the BankAccount class. This is called a *global* variable. Whenever we use this variable in the class, typescript knows what we are talking about. Now let focus on the next segment.  
`
public constructor(initial_amount:number){
        this.balance = initial_amount;
    }
`
So a **constructor** is an essential part of our BankAccount object. Whenever someone is trying to make a BankAccount object, typescript is gonna directly look at the **constructor** in order to know how to make the object. The **constructor** keyword allows us to tell typescript how we want our BankAccount to be *constructed*.  

Also notice the **public** keyword. I am using public here because if I want someone to be using my BankAccount class in another file, how can they access it if it is `private`? We have to make it public so that people can use the **constructor**.   

So inside the paramters of the constructor, there is something called `(initial_amount:number)`. Now this is just like parameters in any function.  

Also notice I put `:number` on the initial_amount parameter. Again we have to tell the ***type*** of the variable we are passing in. In this case when I **construct** the object, I want to know how much balance we are starting out with.  

Now the next part is very important. Look at `this.balance = initial_amount;`. The **this** keyword refers to the object itself(the one you are constructing). We use **this** to refer to the **global** variables we talked about earlier. So we want to set **initial_amount** to the **balance** *global* variable in typescript. We could have also coded this `balance = initial_amount` which is just fine but putting **this** in front of global variables is more specific and avoids any future errors.  

The next parts are just functions which are quite easy to understand. I made a **deposit** method, a **withdraw** method and **getBalance** method.  

```
public deposit(new_money:number):void{
        this.balance += new_money;
    }
    
    public withdraw(money_to_take_out:number):void{
        this.balance -= money_to_take_out;
    }

    public getBalance():number{
        return this.balance;
    }

```  

The **deposit** method just allows us to add money to our balance, the **withdraw** method removes money from our balance, and the **getBalance** method just returns our current balance. So notice the return types after I parenthesis of each function.  

For **deposit** and **withdraw** I put **void**. The keyword **void** is basically a return ***type***. **void** doesn't return anything.   
In this case we aren't returning anything when we call the deposit and withdraw functions we we said `:void` but if you look at the **getBalance** method it has a `:number` return type because it returns our balance which is a **number**.  

Whew! that was a lot. But we finished the bulk of the content. Now that we learned how to make a class, let us see how to use it. 

Let us look at Index.ts where we actually use our BankAccount class  

We import our **BankAccount** class by writing this:  
`import {BankAccount} from './BankAccount.ts'`

Then here I am making a **BankAccount** Object by this line: 
`var Gowtham_Bank_Account = new BankAccount(500);`

I am calling my variable name Gowtham_Bank_Account. The `new` keyword is used to let typescript know that I am **constructing** a new **Object**. Then I type in `BankAccount(500)`. So basically I am saying make a **new** **BankAccount** . Now what is the deal with the `(500)` part?  

Remember in our constructor where we said this:  
```
public constructor(initial_amount:number){
        this.balance = initial_amount;
    }
```

Whenever I make any object, typescript looks at the constructor and sees what parameters I need in order to actually **construct** the object. So in our case we are asking for 1 parameter that which is the **initial_amount** variable. THAT is what the `(500)` part means. I am **constructing** an object that has an initial balance of **500** dollars.
